Project: Multi-Region AWS Infrastructure Deployment**

- Utilized Terraform to orchestrate the deployment of AWS instances across multiple regions (eu-west-1 and eu-central-1), adhering to AWS free-tier limitations.
- Implemented high availability by deploying instances across a minimum of 2 availability zones within each region.
- Developed reusable infrastructure as code (IaC) templates, enabling consistent deployment across multiple environments (dev, prod).
- Created modularized scripts to automate the provisioning of Ansible and Docker containers on the deployed instances, promoting scalability and maintainability.
- Established VPCs for segregating environments, with the development environment hosted in one region and the production environment in another, ensuring isolation and security.

This project showcases my hands-on experience with cloud infrastructure automation, demonstrating proficiency in Terraform, AWS services, and modular scripting practices.
